## Hey!

Since I'm unemployed and have nothing but time to read - add me on Storygraph! - 
and study for techincal interviews, I figured it best to do some [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)
questions for potential interviewers to see my algorithm and data structures
skills. It'll also be proof to me in times of despair that I can actually code.

I'll make the attempt to do a few problems everyday and post their solutions.
If I can find a more optimal solution, I'll eventually merge them to the main 
branch. Don't judge my solutions too bad yall, I'm just a girl. :)

For any recruiters, tech people that wanna connect, or you wanna buy me a flat 
white, or just wanna see what books and movies I'm watching, I've included some
links below on how to reach me:

| 1.29.25 | one_thru_five.py                 | 1-3                   | üòÆ             | 1 and 2 were easy. Could probably find a more optimal solution. Problem 3 had me a little gagged since I've not thought of prime numbers since high school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2.6.25  | one_thru_five.py six_thru_ten.py | 4, 6-10               | ü§™             | Notice that I skipped problem 5. LCM problems are a big head scratcher for me so I will attempt this one another time. Problem 9 proved a bit difficult considering the math behind finding pythagorean triples. I had look up some hits for this one. The others were fairly straightforward. I included a Helper class in the utils for redundant functions, i.e. evaluating prime numbers. |
