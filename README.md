## Hey!

Since I'm unemployed and have nothing but time to read - add me on Storygraph! - 
and study for techincal interviews, I figured it best to do some [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)
questions for potential interviewers to see my algorithm and data structures
skills. It'll also be proof to me in times of despair that I can actually code.

I'll make the attempt to do a few problems everyday and post their solutions.
If I can find a more optimal solution, I'll eventually merge them to the main 
branch. Don't judge my solutions too bad yall, I'm just a girl. :)

For any recruiters, tech people that wanna connect, or you wanna buy me a flat 
white, or just wanna see what books and movies I'm watching, I've included some
links below on how to reach me:

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: the Enjoyability tab is a silly little column measuring how enjoyable I found the problems I did. There measuring system I used is arbitrary so inpret the emojis however you feel.
